#### Agenda 

Quick Summary: Excellent

Feedback:
The agenda was added to the repository before the meeting, giving the other members along with the TA enough time to read through it. It follows the template and the points are clear and concise. I especially appreciate the formatting with the indented bullet points and bolded timings, since it makes the agenda very easy to read through. I do see some inconsistencies, like the aforementioned bolded text not being present in the last few bullet points.

#### Chair performance

Quick Summary: Good

Feedback: 
The chair ensured all topics in the agenda (aside from the one mentioned above) were covered within the allotted time, while also making sure that each topic was given the time it deserved. They politely opened the floor for the other team members to speak, but did take up a slightly disproportionate amount of time. Additionally, they did run out of points on the 30 minute mark, which is, however, very understandable since it was the first meeting.


#### Attitude & Relation

Quick Summary: Excellent

Feedback:
The team took ownership of the meeting and immediately created a good and friendly atmosphere. All members contributed to the discussion at many points and made sure to share their opinions, as well as hearing those of others.
