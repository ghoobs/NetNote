# Meeting

#### Agenda 

Quick Summary: Sufficient

Feedback:

- The agenda was added to the repo in time, giving time to everyone to read it and prepare.
- The agenda contained few points making the meeting quite short. As said in the meeting, I would advise against having meetings right before the TA meeting to avoid this issue.
- The formatting was good and readable.

- There are notes on everything mentioned during the meeting.
- They contain concrete agreements but do not assign work to specific individuals.

#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Quick Summary: Good

Feedback: 

- The students did not discussed the work that they did throughout the last sprint since they discussed that in the separate meeting the day before.
- Distribution seems generally equal.
- They discussed the work they have to complete which also gave me the impression of an equal distribution.
