#### Agenda 

Quick Summary: Good

Feedback:
- The agenda was added with an MR on time, however the MR wasn't actually merged. That's okay, but should be kept in mind for next time. 
- The format looks good.
- The agenda could have a few more items, since it's a bit short and doesn't take full advantage of the meeting time.


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Quick Summary: Excellent

Feedback: 
- There is a good amount of notes which cover the entirety of the meeting.
- The formatting is great, and very easily legible, since it includes indentation and bullet points.
- Concrete agreements were written down as well as general things mentioned in the meeting.


#### Chair performance

Quick Summary: Good

Feedback: 
- The chair managed to cover all of the topics in the allotted time.
- They managed to keep a good pace and open the floor for the rest of the members to contribute.


#### Attitude & Relation

Quick Summary: Good

Feedback: 
- The team took ownership of the meeting, and I only contributed a few times to add to one of their points.
- Mostly everyone was actively involved in the meeting.
- The atmosphere was constructive and everyone seemed to hear eachother out on ideas and opinions.


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Quick Summary: Sufficient

Feedback: 
- The team showed me a part of their project, specifically the markdown renderer.
- There is some progress, but the product is clearly in the foundation stage.
- Pace seems okay, and will naturally speed up though the weeks.


#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Quick Summary: Sufficient

Feedback: 
- The distribution of work in the team is not fully clear yet, but from what is described and from the document, tasks seem to be equally distributed.
- I would strongly recommend against splitting into frontend and backend, as I said during the meeting.
- The tasks file is a good idea, but kind of does the same as issues (which you should use).
