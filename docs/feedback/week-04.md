# Meeting

#### Agenda 

Quick Summary: Good

Feedback:

- The agenda was added to the repository in time, allowing all team members and the TA to read it and prepare.
- The agenda follows the template, with additional formatting that improves readability.
- Timings seem to not be very accurate to the actual meeting duration.


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Quick Summary: Excellent

Feedback: 

- The notes were merged to the agenda file in time.
- There is a good amount of notes, which have good formatting with bullet points and headers which improve readability.
- The notes contain concrete agreements, although I would like to also see what each member was assigned to work on each week.
- The agreements seem realistic and achievable.


#### Chair performance

Quick Summary: Excellent

Feedback: 

- The chair ensured that all topics in the agenda were covered.
- They kept a good pace and made sure all topics were given a good amount of time.
- They introduced new talking points while also giving people the opportunity to talk.


#### Attitude & Relation

Quick Summary: Good
Feedback: 

- The team took ownership of the meeting, only turning to me for questions.
- Mostly everyone was active in the meeting, although I'd like to hear more from certain people.
- The atmosphere was constructive and friendly and all ideas were taken into account.


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Quick Summary: Good

Feedback: 

- The team presented their current product after being asked, which I would like to see them do as an agenda item from now on.
- The application was potentially shippable, as most features implemented worked, with the exception of the markdown feature which was on a pending merge request.
- There has been good progress since last week and I believe the team is on track to have a working application by the end of the project.


#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Quick Summary: Good

Feedback: 

- The students discussed what they each did last week.
- Students seem to have reached their goals and everybody seems to be contributing a similar amount to the product.
- I'd like to see less focus on a "backend-frontend" system and more feature-based work distribution.
