Post-meeting 1 notes (minute taker): 

- *Main focus assignment*
  - teamwork is the back-bone of the course, the result of this will by design be the web-application.
  - We have to work on both front-end and back-end equally, to avoid inequality.
- *Knockout criteria*
  - tasks that have to be done per week, found in bright space.
  - this is the bare minimum, should be more realistically
- *Code of conduct*
  - Deadline next week friday, will discuss and write this next week
  - Should contain various things related to teamwork/communication/goals
- *Grading*
  - Always check rubric, work by it, keep it in mind at all times.
  - Goal of everyone is max grade, for this we will ensure solid foundation of the project and consistent teamwork and communication.
- *Learning*
  - Reading Java effects doc, fxml and about general concepts throughout the project, to ensure equal knowledge
  - At first, we will divide tasks based on strengths, but we will learn from each other through feedback. 
- *Checkstyle*
  - General requirements for all classes, less strict than IP, but consistent and fair.
  - Look at existing check style and follow equal structure.
  - Javadoc for everything, we can auto generate that for the most part, as this is not AI it counts towards line goals.
- *Unit testing*
  - For max grade we should also test front-end (80% total line coverage for last year).
  - We can get away with lower testing on parts of front-end by aiming for near 100% line coverage in back-end.
- *General things*
  - Generative AI can be used, but have to be cited properly, might not account for test line coverage, and does not count towards line goals.
